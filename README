A program that scrapes gpu prices from best buy and adds them to a database file. Old prices will be overwritten if the sku name matches.

To run, perform the following:

Update your path environment variable by running
"source ./GDPath.sh"
from the python-components directory
The default path in this script is the directory you are currently in.
This script requires GECKODRIVER to run, which is not included for licensing reasons.

Assuming the default directory structure, one can then run
./gpu-script.sh
and the program will run in a different window
