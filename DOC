###
	Purpose: To store piped information provided by Python web scraper in a database and evaluate whether prices on specific items have changed
###

Tasks that need to be completed:
	Read input
		Distinguish between SKU names and PRICES
		Accept an END signal

	Compare current data to previous data to determine drops in price

	Store input as UNIQUE items
		Maybe binary tree? For quick search speed
		OR Set for ensured uniqueness



DETAILS:
	Data will be input as two values:
	One line of CHARS
		Format: sagas bla bla EXTREME
	One line of CHARS that need to be converted to DOUBLES
		Format: $12445.23

	Prices will be compared to only most recent price listed

	Options for data structure:
		Struct:
			string
			double
			
			Save in plain text

		Input will be quite slow, so speed is not necessarily critical
		Binary tree will suffice, but may not be best choice?
